# timezone

A command line implementation of [Coding Challenge #85](https://codingchallenges.substack.com/p/coding-challenge-85-time-zone-converter)

Using this as a vehicle to understand the C# language, ecosystem, guidelines; the .Net framework; VS Code as the IDE for a C# project; and using an AI assistant ([Phind](https://www.phind.com)) - as opposed to Googling - to answer questions/find solutions.

## Activity

### Day 1

- Spent some time asking Phind
